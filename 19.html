        <p>The YouTube channel Orhan Records (also referred to as @orhanvidz) launched on October 18, 2022, and has since
        amassed around 129,000 subscribers, demonstrating a solid base of engaged followers with a respectable 4.6%
        engagement rate. Despite publishing only four videos to date, the channel draws significant weekly attention,
        averaging over 103,000 views in the last 30 days. Its content tends to be longer than average—the videos run
        about 24½ minutes, suggesting in-depth or storytelling formats. Impressively, the channel can generate an
        estimated $181 to $543 per month from YouTube, reflecting its established audience and content value. However,
        uploads appear to be somewhat sporadic, with the most recent content published in early January 2024.</p>
